## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

# Afterhours

## What This Is
A curated nightlife guide for Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, with real public event listings. The Next.js app deploys as a static site to GitHub Pages.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript strict)
- **UI:** shadcn/ui (Base UI primitives, Tailwind CSS v4, `cn()` utility)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (default — will be replaced/supplemented by extracted SVGs)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 with oklch design tokens
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — Start dev server
- `npm run build` — Production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint check
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript check
- `npm run check` — Run lint + typecheck + build

## Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode, no `any`
- Named exports, PascalCase components, camelCase utils
- Tailwind utilities or scoped CSS; avoid inline styles unless behavior needs dynamic values
- 2-space indentation
- Responsive: mobile-first

## Design Principles
- **Pixel-perfect emulation** — match the target's spacing, colors, typography exactly
- **No personal aesthetic changes during emulation phase** — match 1:1 first, customize later
- **Real content** — use actual text and assets from the target site, not placeholders
- **Beauty-first** — every pixel matters

## Agent Workflow
- Edit `.agents/skills/clone-website/` for cloning-workflow changes. It is the canonical skill used by Codex, Cursor, and OpenCode.
- Keep `.claude/commands/clone-website.md` as a thin Claude Code bridge to the canonical skill; do not duplicate the workflow there.
